# Bhojpur Action - Software Build & Release

The `Bhojpur Action` is a custom software build and release automation engine based on the [Bhojpur ISO](https://github.com/bhojpur/iso/) toolkit, which is pre-integrated with the `GitHub` platform already. It is used across the organisation by [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) development teams for automation purposes.

Please feel free to use it in your GitHub repository workflows. Also, you could contact [us](https://www.bhojpur-consulting.com) through our [Global Support Centre](https://desk.bhojpur-consulting.com), if you have any queries specifically related to this software tool.
